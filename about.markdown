#### Hi, everyone. Welcome to my website.

I am a PhD student in English, working in the general fields of critical theory, cultural studies, and 20th- and 21st-century literature. The project I'm currently working my way toward defining deals with the situation of critical theory and cultural criticism—especially in their Marxist veins—and their relation to the vexed institutional condition of the university.

Beyond that broader project, I'm also interested in speculative fiction, visual culture, religious studies, and political philosophy. I've taught courses on first-year composition, technical writing, reading skills, and science fiction. (For more on my professional experience, [see my CV](CV.md).) In what time I can scavenge or steal, I like to draw and paint. 

This site falls somewhere between a professional personal site and a casual blog for thinking aloud.
